happiness-index-2018-2019,"About data: This study analyzes the association between the Happiness Index Score in 2018 and 2019 and a set of independent variables such as 'Overall rank' 'GDP per capita' 'Social support' 'Healthy life expectancy' 'Freedom to make life choices' 'Generosity' and 'Perceptions of corruption'. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of these independent variables on the level of happiness of individuals during these two years. In addition a country-wise analysis was conducted to examine variations in variables between the top-ranking happiest country and India. Multiple visualizations were employed to identify and illustrate these differences in a clear and concise manner.Dependent & Independent variables: The first independent variable is GDP per capita which represents the economic well-being of a country's residents. The second variable freedom to make life choices represents the level of autonomy and control individuals have over their lives. The third variable health life expectancy indicates the length of time individuals can expect to live in good health. The fourth variable perception of corruption reflects the extent to which corruption is perceived to be prevalent in a society. Finally the fifth variable social support measures the extent to which individuals have access to support from family friends and other social networks.By examining the relationship between these independent variables and the Happiness Index Score the study aims to contribute to the understanding of the factors that impact individuals' happiness levels. The results of this study could be useful for policymakers and other stakeholders in identifying areas for intervention and improvement to enhance the overall well-being of the population.Overview of the Data (2018 & 2019)AbstractThis study aims to investigate the relationship between the Happiness Index Score and several independent variables namely GDP per capita social support healthy life expectancy freedom to make life choices and perceptions of corruption in the years 2018 and 2019. By analyzing these variables we sought to identify the factors that significantly influence individuals' happiness levels and contribute to a better understanding of the factors that impact overall well-being. The study used regression analysis to examine the statistical significance of these variables and their impact on the dependent variable the Happiness Index Score. The results indicate that all independent variables significantly influence the Happiness Index Score and can explain up to 98.6% and 98.1% of the variance in the dependent variable in 2018 and 2019 respectively. Moreover the analysis suggests that social support and GDP per capita are the main parameters that differentiate Finland from India in terms of happiness levels. The findings of this study could be useful for policymakers and stakeholders in identifying areas for intervention and improvement to enhance the overall well-being of the population.Keywords: Happiness Index Score GDP per capita social support healthy life expectancy freedom to make life choices perceptions of corruption regression analysis Finland India.Introduction:The pursuit of happiness has been a central theme in human societies throughout history. The Happiness Index Score is a measure of well-being that has gained considerable attention in recent years as an indicator of a country's overall prosperity and quality of life. The Happiness Index Score is calculated based on several variables including GDP per capita social support healthy life expectancy freedom to make life choices perceptions of corruption and generosity.The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of these variables on the Happiness Index Score in 2018 and 2019 and to identify the factors that significantly influence individuals' happiness levels. The study aims to contribute to the understanding of the factors that impact overall well-being and to provide insights for policymakers and stakeholders in identifying areas for intervention and improvement.Methodology:The study used regression analysis to examine the relationship between the Happiness Index Score and independent variables namely GDP per capita social support healthy life expectancy freedom to make life choices and perceptions of corruption. The data for this study was obtained from the World Happiness Report for the years 2018 and 2019. The analysis was conducted using Python programming and all the visualizations were created using the same.Results:The regression analysis revealed that all independent variables significantly influence the Happiness Index Score in both 2018 and 2019. The adjusted R squared values of 0.986 and 0.981 in 2018 and 2019 respectively indicate a robust model capable of explaining a large proportion of the variance in the dependent variable. Moreover the p-values associated with the F statistics were less than 0.05 indicating that the model is statistically significant and reliable.Firstly a regression analysis was conducted for dataset ""Happiness Index 2018"". Here The regression model indicates that the independent variables namely GDP per capita social support freedom to make life choices generosity and perceptions of corruption significantly influence the dependent variable which is the Happiness Index Score. This finding suggests that variations in the aforementioned independent variables can considerably affect positively the level of happiness in a given population. It is worth noting that all the independent variables have p-values less than 0.05 indicating that they are statistically significant in the model. Additionally the adjusted R squared value of 0.986 is indicative of a robust model which can explain 98.6% of the variance in the dependent variable. Moreover the p-value associated with the F statistics is also less than 0.05 further strengthening the evidence that the model is significant and capable of producing reliable results. Overall these findings suggest that the regression model is valid and can be used to make accurate predictions about the Happiness Index Score based on the selected independent variables.Thereafter another regression analysis was conducted for dataset ""Happiness Index 2019"" to investigate the influence of social support freedom to make life choices generosity and perceptions of corruption on the happiness index score. The analysis revealed that all independent variables significantly influenced the dependent variable indicating that the happiness index score varied greatly based on these factors. The statistical significance of these variables was confirmed by a p-value of less than 0.05. The robustness of the model was also demonstrated by an adjusted R squared value of 0.981. Moreover the p-value associated with F statistics was less than 0.05 suggesting that the model was good. These findings suggest that policymakers and organizations could target these independent variables to enhance overall happiness levels.Furthermore the country-wise analysis showed that Finland had significantly higher levels of GDP per capita and social support compared to India which were the two main factors contributing to the difference in happiness levels between the two countries.Conclusion:The study concludes that the independent variables namely GDP per capita social support healthy life expectancy freedom to make life choices and perceptions of corruption significantly influence the Happiness Index Score in both 2018 and 2019. The findings suggest that policymakers and stakeholders could target these variables to enhance overall well-being and happiness levels. The analysis also highlights the importance of GDP per capita and social support in determining the Happiness Index Score and differentiating countries' happiness levels as demonstrated by the comparison of Finland and India.The study contributes to the understanding of the factors that impact individuals' happiness levels and provides insights for policymakers and stakeholders in identifying areas for intervention and improvement.Code link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/sougatapramanick/soug009",10.00,https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sougatapramanick/happiness-index-2018-2019

olid-i,Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the globe by storm since its inception and the enormous agriculture sector is no exception. The progress of any AI-assisted mechanism is heavily reliant on massive training data. Although the application of AI in plant leaf management has garnered prominence in recent years there is still a dearth of data especially in the case of tropical and subtropical crops. In light of this we present a public dataset containing 4749 leaf images which include healthy nutritionally deficient and pest-infested leaves of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) eggplant (Solanum melongena) cucumber (Cucumis sativus) bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) snake gourd (Trichosanthes cucumerina) ridge gourd (Luffa acutangula) ash gourd (Benincasa hispida) and bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria). The dataset comprises 57 unique classes with high-resolution photos (3024 x 3024). The images have been captured at three different sites in Bangladesh in natural field settings and arduously labeled by an expert panel. This collection features the highest number of plant stress classes and the first multi-label classification problem in the agro-domain. The effective utilization of our dataset will result in an abundance of leaf disease diagnosis algorithms pest identification and classification tools and nutritional deficiency estimation strategies to highlight a few.Note: The excel file comprises a detailed class distribution.,8.75,https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raiaone/olid-i

imagesoasis,The dataset used is the OASIS MRI dataset which consists of 80000 brain MRI images. The images have been divided into four classes based on Alzheimer's progression. The dataset aims to provide a valuable resource for analyzing and detecting early signs of Alzheimer's disease.To make the dataset accessible the original .img and .hdr files were converted into Nifti format (.nii) using FSL (FMRIB Software Library). The converted MRI images of 461 patients have been uploaded to a GitHub repository which can be accessed in multiple parts.For the neural network training 2D images were used as input. The brain images were sliced along the z-axis into 256 pieces and slices ranging from 100 to 160 were selected from each patient. This approach resulted in a comprehensive dataset for analysis.Patient classification was performed based on the provided metadata and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) values resulting in four classes: demented very mild demented mild demented and non-demented. These classes enable the detection and study of different stages of Alzheimer's disease progression.During the dataset preparation the .nii MRI scans were converted to .jpg files. Although this conversion presented some challenges the files were successfully processed using appropriate tools. The resulting dataset size is 1.3 GB.With this comprehensive dataset the project aims to explore various neural network models and achieve optimal results in Alzheimer's disease detection and analysis.,8.75,https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninadaithal/imagesoasis

creditcardfraud,It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days where we have 492 frauds out of 284807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately due to confidentiality issues we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1 V2 … V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise. Given the class imbalance ratio we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.A simulator for transaction data has been released as part of the practical handbook on Machine Learning for Credit Card Fraud Detection - https://fraud-detection-handbook.github.io/fraud-detection-handbook/Chapter_3_GettingStarted/SimulatedDataset.html. We invite all practitioners interested in fraud detection datasets to also check out this data simulator and the methodologies for credit card fraud detection presented in the book.The dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Université Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection.More details on current and past projects on related topics are available on https://www.researchgate.net/project/Fraud-detection-5 and the page of the DefeatFraud projectPlease cite the following works: Andrea Dal Pozzolo Olivier Caelen Reid A.

novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset,From World Health Organization - On 31 December 2019 WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City Hubei Province of China. The virus did not match any other known virus. This raised concern because when a virus is new we do not know how it affects people.So daily level information on the affected people can give some interesting insights when it is made available to the broader data science community. Johns Hopkins University has made an excellent dashboard using the affected cases data. Data is extracted from the google sheets associated and made available here.Edited: Now data is available as csv files in the Johns Hopkins Github repository. Please refer to the github repository for the Terms of Use details. Uploading it here for using it in Kaggle kernels and getting insights from the broader DS community. 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus (more specifically a coronavirus) identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan China. Early on many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market suggesting animal-to-person spread. However a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. At this time it’s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people - CDCThis dataset has daily level information on the number of affected cases deaths and recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus. Please note that this is a time series data and so the number of cases on any given day is the cumulative number.

Illustrative Examples of Chest X-Rays in Patients with Pneumonia Related to Figure 6The normal chest X-ray (left panel) depicts clear lungs without any areas of abnormal opacification in the image. Bacterial pneumonia (middle) typically exhibits a focal lobar consolidation in this case in the right upper lobe (white arrows) whereas viral pneumonia (right) manifests with a more diffuse ‘‘interstitial’’ pattern in both lungs.http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30154-5The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train test val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal).  There are 5863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal). Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care. For the analysis of chest x-ray images all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. In order to account for any grading errors the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert.Data: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2License: CC BY 4.0Citation: http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30154-5Automated methods to detect and classify human diseases from medical images.,7.50,https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

youtube-new,UPDATE: Source code used for collecting this data released hereYouTube (the world-famous video sharing website) maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. According to Variety magazine “To determine the year’s top-trending videos YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views shares comments and likes). Note that they’re not the most-viewed videos overall for the calendar year”. Top performers on the YouTube trending list are music videos (such as the famously virile “Gangam Style”) celebrity and/or reality TV performances and the random dude-with-a-camera viral videos that YouTube is well-known for.This dataset is a daily record of the top trending YouTube videos.Note that this dataset is a structurally improved version of this dataset.This dataset includes several months (and counting) of data on daily trending YouTube videos. Data is included for the US GB DE CA and FR regions (USA Great Britain Germany Canada and France respectively) with up to 200 listed trending videos per day.EDIT: Now includes data from RU MX KR JP and IN regions (Russia Mexico South Korea Japan and India respectively) over the same time period.  Each region’s data is in a separate file. Data includes the video title channel title publish time tags views likes and dislikes description and comment count.The data also includes a category_id field which varies between regions. To retrieve the categories for a specific video find it in the associated JSON. One such file is included for each of the five regions in the dataset.For more information on specific columns in the dataset refer to the column metadata.This dataset was collected using the YouTube API.Possible uses for this dataset could include:For further inspiration see the kernels on this dataset!,7.94,https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new

I have  called those foreign keys ""api_id"".Improving the dataset: You will notice that some players are missing from the lineup (NULL values). This is because I have not been able to source their attributes from FIFA. This will be fixed overtime as the crawling algorithm is being improved.The dataset will also be expanded to include international games national cups Champion's League and Europa League. Please ask me if you're after a specific tournament.Please get in touch with me if you want to help improve this dataset. CLICK HERE TO ACCESS THE PROJECT GITHUBImportant note for people interested in using the crawlers: since I first wrote the crawling scripts (in python) it appears sofifa.com has changed its design and with it comes new requirements for the scripts. The existing script to crawl players ('Player Spider') will not work until i've updated it.Exploring the data:Now that's the fun part there is a lot you can do with this dataset. I will be adding visuals and insights to this overview page but please have a look at the kernels and give it a try yourself ! Here are some ideas for you:The Holy Grail…… is obviously to predict the outcome of the game. The bookies use 3 classes (Home Win Draw Away Win). They get it right about 53% of the time. This is also what I've achieved so far using my own SVM. Though it may sound high for such a random sport game you've got to know that the home team wins about 46% of the time. So the base case (constantly predicting Home Win) has indeed 46% precision. Probabilities vs OddsWhen running a multi-class classifier like SVM you could also output a probability estimate and compare it to the betting odds. Have a look at your variance vs odds and see for what games you had very different predictions.Explore and visualize featuresWith access to players and teams attributes team formations and in-game events you should be able to produce some interesting insights into The Beautiful Game .

price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs,High-quality financial data is expensive to acquire and is therefore rarely shared for free.  Here I provide the full historical daily price and volume data for all US-based stocks and ETFs trading on the NYSE NASDAQ and NYSE MKT. It's one of the best datasets of its kind you can obtain. The data (last updated 11/10/2017) is presented in CSV format as follows: Date Open High Low Close Volume OpenInt. Note that prices have been adjusted for dividends and splits. This dataset belongs to me. I’m sharing it here for free. You may do with it as you wish. Many have tried but most have failed to predict the stock market's ups and downs. Can you do any better? ,7.50,https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs
world-happiness,The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The first report was published in 2012 the second in 2013 the third in 2015 and the fourth in the 2016 Update. The World Happiness 2017 which ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels was released at the United Nations at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness on March 20th. The report continues to gain global recognition as governments organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics psychology survey analysis national statistics health public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness. The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question known as the Cantril ladder asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The scores are from nationally representative samples for the years 2013-2016 and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production social support life expectancy freedom absence of corruption and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.What countries or regions rank the highest in overall happiness and each of the six factors contributing to happiness? How did country ranks or scores change between the 2015 and 2016 as well as the 2016 and 2017 reports? Did any country experience a significant increase or decrease in happiness?What is Dystopia?Dystopia is an imaginary country that has the world’s least-happy people. The purpose in establishing Dystopia is to have a benchmark against which all countries can be favorably compared (no country performs more poorly than Dystopia) in terms of each of the six key variables thus allowing each sub-bar to be of positive width. The lowest scores observed for the six key variables therefore characterize Dystopia. Since life would be very unpleasant in a country with the world’s lowest incomes lowest life expectancy lowest generosity most corruption least freedom and least social support it is referred to as “Dystopia” in contrast to Utopia.What are the residuals?The residuals or unexplained components differ for each country reflecting the extent to which the six variables either over- or under-explain average 2014-2016 life evaluations. These residuals have an average value of approximately zero over the whole set of countries. Figure 2.2 shows the average residual for each country when the equation in Table 2.1 is applied to average 2014- 2016 data for the six variables in that country. We combine these residuals with the estimate for life evaluations in Dystopia so that the combined bar will always have positive values. As can be seen in Figure 2.2 although some life evaluation residuals are quite large occasionally exceeding one point on the scale from 0 to 10 they are always much smaller than the calculated value in Dystopia where the average life is rated at 1.85 on the 0 to 10 scale.What do the columns succeeding the Happiness Score(like Family Generosity etc.) describe?The following columns: GDP per Capita Family Life Expectancy Freedom Generosity Trust Government Corruption describe the extent to which these factors contribute in evaluating the happiness in each country. The Dystopia Residual metric actually is the Dystopia Happiness Score(1.85) +  the Residual value or the unexplained value for each country as stated in the previous answer.If you add all these factors up you get the happiness score so it might be un-reliable to model them to predict Happiness Scores.,8.53,https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness

pima-indians-diabetes-database,This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had their BMI insulin level age and so on.Smith J.W. Everhart J.E. Dickson W.C. Knowler W.C. & Johannes R.S. (1988).

wine-reviews,After watching Somm (a documentary on master sommeliers) I wondered how I could create a predictive model to identify wines through blind tasting like a master sommelier would. The first step in this journey was gathering some data to train a model. I plan to use deep learning to predict the wine variety using words in the description/review. The model still won't be able to taste the wine but theoretically it could identify the wine based on a description that a sommelier could give. If anyone has any ideas on how to accomplish this please post them!This dataset contains three files:winemag-data-130k-v2.csv contains 10 columns and 130k rows of wine reviews. winemag-data_first150k.csv contains 10 columns and 150k rows of wine reviews.  winemag-data-130k-v2.json contains 6919 nodes of wine reviews. Click on the data tab to see individual file descriptions column-level metadata and summary statistics.The data was scraped from WineEnthusiast during the week of June 15th 2017. The code for the scraper can be found here if you have any more specific questions about data collection that I didn't address.UPDATE 11/24/2017After feedback from users of the dataset I scraped the reviews again on November 22nd 2017. This time around I collected the title of each review which you can parse the year out of the tasters name and the taster's Twitter handle. This should also fix the duplicate entry issue.I think that this dataset offers some great opportunities for sentiment analysis and other text related predictive models. My overall goal is to create a model that can identify the variety winery and location of a wine based on a description. If anyone has any ideas breakthroughs or other interesting insights/models please post them.,7.94,https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews
avocado-prices,It is a well known fact that Millenials LOVE Avocado Toast. It's also a well known fact that all Millenials live in their parents basements.Clearly they aren't buying home because they are buying too much Avocado Toast!But maybe there's hope… if a Millenial could find a city with cheap avocados they could live out the Millenial American Dream.This data was downloaded from the Hass Avocado Board website in May of 2018 & compiled into a single CSV. Here's how the Hass Avocado Board describes the data on their website:The table below represents weekly 2018 retail scan data for National retail volume (units) and price. Retail scan data comes directly from retailers’ cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. Starting in 2013 the table below reflects an expanded multi-outlet retail data set. Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery mass club drug dollar and military. The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes (PLU’s) in the table are only for Hass avocados. Other varieties of avocados (e.g. greenskins) are not included in this table.Some relevant columns in the dataset:Many thanks to the Hass Avocado Board for sharing this data!!http://www.hassavocadoboard.com/retail/volume-and-price-dataIn which cities can millenials have their avocado toast AND buy a home?Was the Avocadopocalypse of 2017 real?,9.71,https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neuromusic/avocado-prices
tmdb-movie-metadata,What can we say about the success of a movie before it is released? Are there certain companies (Pixar?) that have found a consistent formula? Given that major films costing over $100 million to produce can still flop this question is more important than ever to the industry. Film aficionados might have different interests. Can we predict which films will be highly rated whether or not they are a commercial success?This is a great place to start digging in to those questions with data on the plot cast crew budget and revenues of several thousand films.We (Kaggle) have removed the original version of this dataset per a DMCA takedown request from IMDB. In order to minimize the impact we're replacing it with a similar set of films and data fields from The Movie Database (TMDb) in accordance with their terms of use. The bad news is that kernels built on the old dataset will most likely no longer work.The good news is that:You can port your existing kernels over with a bit of editing. This kernel offers functions and examples for doing so. You can also find a general introduction to the new format here.The new dataset contains full credits for both the cast and the crew rather than just the first three actors.Actor and actresses are now listed in the order they appear in the credits. It's unclear what ordering the original dataset used; for the movies I spot checked it didn't line up with either the credits order or IMDB's stars order.The revenues appear to be more current. For example IMDB's figures for Avatar seem to be from 2010 and understate the film's global revenues by over $2 billion.Some of the movies that we weren't able to port over (a couple of hundred) were just bad entries. For example this IMDB entry has basically no accurate information at all. It lists Star Wars Episode VII as a documentary.Several of the new columns contain json. You can save a bit of time by porting the load data functions [from this kernel]().Even in simple fields like runtime may not be consistent across versions. For example previous dataset shows the duration for Avatar's extended cut while TMDB shows the time for the original version.There's now a separate file containing the full credits for both the cast and crew.All fields are filled out by users so don't expect them to agree on keywords genres ratings or the like.Your existing kernels will continue to render normally until they are re-run.If you are curious about how this dataset was prepared the code to access TMDb's API is posted here.New columns:homepageidoriginal_titleoverviewpopularityproduction_companiesproduction_countriesrelease_datespoken_languagesstatustaglinevote_averageLost columns:actor_1_facebook_likesactor_2_facebook_likesactor_3_facebook_likesaspect_ratiocast_total_facebook_likescolorcontent_ratingdirector_facebook_likesfacenumber_in_postermovie_facebook_likesmovie_imdb_linknum_critic_for_reviewsnum_user_for_reviewsThere are some things we haven't had a chance to confirm about the new dataset. If you have any insights please let us know in the forums!Are the budgets and revenues all in US dollars? Do they consistently show the global revenues?This dataset hasn't yet gone through a data quality analysis. Can you find any obvious corrections? For example in the IMDb version it was necessary to treat values of zero in the budget field as missing. Similar findings would be very helpful to your fellow Kagglers! (It's probably a good idea to keep treating zeros as missing with the caveat that missing budgets much more likely to have been from small budget films in the first place).Can you categorize the films by type such as animated or not? We don't have explicit labels for this but it should be possible to build them from the crew's job titles.How sharp is the divide between major film studios and the independents? Do those two groups fall naturally out of a clustering analysis or is something more complicated going on?This dataset was generated from The Movie Database API. This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.Their API also provides access to data on many additional movies actors and actresses crew members and TV shows.
